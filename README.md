## How to run the Ruby program

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

2. Run the program

```sh
cd <folder_name>/

ruby <name_of_ruby_program>.rb
```

Or using the Interactive Ruby Shell (type irb in the terminal/console)

Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. The abbreviation irb comes from the fact that the filename extension for Ruby is ".rb", although interactive Ruby files do not have an extension of ".irb".
